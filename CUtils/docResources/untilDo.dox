You can also generates `until ... do` cycles. Until do cycles operates as follows:
 @li enter in the cycle if condition is false
 @li process the whole cycle
 @li as soon as a cycle has terminated, recheck condition
 @li continue until `condition` is true
 
 Here's an example of an until do cycle:
@code
 int i=0;
 bool stop = false;
CU_UNTIL (stop==true) CU_DO {
	i++;
	if (i >=5) {
		stop = true;
	}
}
