Usually @c new functions always malloc data in the heap. This function is different: it returns @c NULL if @c enable is false.
This is done for the following purpose: if we don't want to enable statistics, the statistics themselves shouldn't do anything at all.
This is why all the functions in this module allows the involved structure ::online_statistics_pool to be ::CU_NULLABLE, instead of being ::CU_NOTNULL,
(i.e., the cuNewOSP may return NULL).
In the same way, ::cuDestroyOSP may deal with a null value as well. 
 
In this way, the user code doesn't need to know if the structure has been created or not: the module will automatically detect it.
